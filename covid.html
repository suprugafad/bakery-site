    <p style="font-weight: bold"> Tartine Community </p>
    <p>
        We are following all CDC and local health department COVID-19 guidelines to ensure the safety of both our
        guests and our teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we navigate COVID-19 and the reopening of our locations for take-out and dine in, we wanted to share
        the procedures we are implementing, and the protocols we are asking our guests to support us with.
    </p>
    <p> The health of our community is our top priority. </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold"> Employee Practices </p>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Team members are required to stay home from work if they are experiencing any symptoms related to COVID-19</li>
    <li>All employees get temperature checked daily; a temperature above 100.4 F will be sent home</li>
    <li>Employees are required to wear masks and socially distance while at work, masks are provided</li>
    <li>Employees handling payment must sanitize before and after touching an external form of payment.
        We are sanitizing high touch areas after each use or every 30 minutes, whichever is more frequent</li>
    <li>Employees must wash hands with soap and water every 30 minutes or whenever beginning or ending a new task.
        If wearing gloves, gloves should be changed with the same frequency</li>
    <li>We are designating specific bathrooms in each location as employee-only where possible</li>
    <li>Any confirmed case of COVID-19 within our spaces will be immediately communicated to local health authorities
        (as per local requirements), HR, and any team member that has had close contact* with that individual. An outside
        agency will come in to sanitize the affected space before opening for employees or guests</li>
    <li>If a team member has had close contact* with a confirmed case of COVID-19, they will isolate at home until tested and will
        inform their manager immediately of this potential exposure</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p style = "font-weight: bold"> Guest Practices </p>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Guests must social distance (6 feet) when in our spaces</li>
    <li>Guests must wear masks at all times inside. If eating or drinking outside, please wear your mask to and from your table</li>
    <li>If you are experiencing symptoms, please do not enter our spaces for the safety of our teams and community</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Thank you all for your continued support and flexibility with us as we adjust to this new normal and open our spaces to our
        amazing communities!</p>
    <p>Come back soon and often!</p>
    <p>Love, Tartine</p>
